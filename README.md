# OfficeByte

Managing office rentals is often manual, time-consuming, and inefficient, especially for property 
owners with multiple tenants and properties. Tasks like tracking availability, generating invoices, 
and managing leases involve paperwork and can lead to delays or errors. 
OfficeByte aims to simplify office rental management by automating key processes. The system 
allows property owners to: 
1. Update and display property availability. 
2. Automatically generate electricity bills and rental invoices. 
3. Manage the client information.  
With OfficeByte, property owners can reduce manual work, eliminate paperwork, and improve 
communication with tenants, resulting in a smoother rental process.
